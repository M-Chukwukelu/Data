Finally documenting all the work I have done to learn data science.

All files in DataProject0 were part of the assessments for  DATA 201 - 'Thinking with Data' taught in Winter 2023 by Dr. Nelson Wong at the University of Calgary.

DataProject0 was done in a group but due to privacy concerns, their names have been removed.
